# ds_salary_h1b
Inspired by this article "How Much Do Data Scientists Make?" I decided to take the same data source and do some analysis in a sligtly different way. 
- [00_data_check.ipynb](https://github.com/krystinli/ds_salary_h1b/blob/master/00_data_check.ipynb) - initial data cleanning
- [01_data_all_jobs.ipynb](https://github.com/krystinli/ds_salary_h1b/blob/master/00_data_check.ipynb) - a quick look at other data related job families
