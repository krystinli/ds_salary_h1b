### html_tags
Tags have commonly used names that depend on their position in relation to other tags:
- `child` — a child is a tag inside another tag. So the two p tags above are both children of the body tag:
```html
<html>
    <head>
    </head>
  
    <body>
        <p>
        Here's a paragraph of text!
        </p>
      
        <p>
        Here's a second paragraph of text!
        </p>
    </body>
  
</html>
```
